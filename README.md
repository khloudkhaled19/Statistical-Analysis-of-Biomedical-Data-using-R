# Statistical-Analysis-of-Biomedical-Data-using-R
This course is a set of tasks that serve several biomedical aspects. The repo has R implementation of the following tasks:

1- Converting DNA sequence to RNA sequence.

2- Given a gene expression dataset, apply preprocessing techniques, normalization, and visualizing the output after.

3- Given a dataset of 4 genes, for each gene, create 2 gene expression profiles which are condition and control, to satisfy a set of rules. Then, test a number of hypotheses. 

4- Given a file of 100 P-values, apply the two correction methods Bonferroni and FDR to reduce false positives.

5- Given a dataset of healthy and cancerous tissues for the same gene, use hypothesis testing in 2 different methods to investigate whether cancer changes the expression level for this gen.
